## What is this?
This is the WIP branch of the Whiskers rewrite ( redux )

## Why are you rewriting it?
To make it more modular and approachable, as well as create a better user interface

## Could you not just extend the existing code?
Yes, I could. But I'm not :cat:

## Goals
- [ ] Make codebase modular, to make it easier to add custom nodes and features
- [ ] Make user interface less like Godot, and more like a proper graph editor
- [ ] Make Whiskers dialogue assets smaller and more light-weight. This will be done by having one save file, which contains all graph node positions as well as dialogue text, and also having a `Compile` option which stores *just* the dialogue text.
- [ ] ( Optional ) Switch from JSON to something more readable. Maybe YAML?

## Can I help?
Definitely! Suggestions, feedback, pull requests etc are all awesome!
